# BigFridge

A web application built in Javascript.

### Goal

Decrease food waste!  I set out to create a food-sharing application analogous to AirBnB for your leftovers.  Users post their leftovers to the BigFridge, share a BigFridge with those they choose, and can reserve meals from each other.

### Tools Used

Angular, Firebase, Bootstrap

### Installation

Create new repository and enter the following command:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/jstiltner/BigFridge.git
```

Run the following commands to install all dependencies:

```sh
$ npm install
$ bower install
```

Now you can show the app in your browser by running this Terminal command:

```sh
http-server
```

To open the application, type the following into the URL bar of your browser
```sh
http://localhost:8080
```
